# WWBank

This is my first web app meaning its the first time I used any backend tool ever in my life and built this.This is a web app made using HTML, CSS, EJS, NODE JS, EXPRESS JS, MYSQL. It allows you to do things like creating an account,adding money into it , debiting money from it etc(Obviously not real money.). 
I also have used express session in it. I built it for learning purposes so I have'nt hosted it yet.

Here are some pics of the project.

If you noticed the inconsisteny of the colors in the title bar in the pics above that's because there is an animation running all over the website which makes it change the color.
Thanks for reading the post.
